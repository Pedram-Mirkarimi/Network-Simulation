"Figure 1 – Overview of the simulation"

The process of finding the right way to transfer data in a network or from one network to another is called routing. Routers perform routing in two ways, which are:
1) static routing
2) dynamic routing

In this project, it is intended to talk about static routing. At first, the simulation that has three separate networks is displayed with a picture.

"Figure 3 - Network number two"

Networks Components:
1. PC
2. Switch 2960
3. Straight Cable
The only thing that distinguishes two networks (network one and two) is their IP.
The range of IP networks is as follows:
Network one: 192.168.1.0
Network two: 172.16.1.0

A network can have various devices such as: computer, laptop, printer, server, etc., in this project, the existence of a PC is sufficient for data transfer.

In networks one and two, at first, the computers are connected to the switch with a direct cable, then the PCs are given IPs based on their existence in a different network.

*Of course, it should be noted that PC1's IP is class "C" and PC2's IP is class "B".
